# Image Classification - CIFAR-10 Dataset with CNN

## üìã Project Overview
This project focuses on image classification using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which contains a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. The dataset is widely used for benchmarking machine learning models, particularly in the field of computer vision. The goal of this project is to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to accurately classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- **Objective**: To build and evaluate a CNN model for image classification tasks, specifically targeting the identification of objects across different classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 images, with 50,000 used for training and 10,000 for testing, divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## üîç Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Prior to modeling, various data exploration and preprocessing steps were undertaken:

- **Data Overview**: Analyzed the dataset to understand the distribution of classes and the characteristics of the images.
- **Normalization**: Normalized the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 to improve the model's convergence during training.
- **Data Augmentation**: Implemented data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, zooming) to enhance model robustness and prevent overfitting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Model Development
The core of this project involves constructing a CNN model for image classification:

- **Model Architecture**: Designed a CNN architecture featuring convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Activation Functions**: Utilized activation functions (e.g., ReLU for hidden layers and Softmax for the output layer) to facilitate non-linear transformations and classify the output.
- **Compilation**: Compiled the model with an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a suitable loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) for multi-class classification.
- **Training**: Trained the model on the training dataset while monitoring performance metrics such as accuracy and loss.

## üìä Results and Evaluation
After training the model, the following evaluation metrics were utilized to assess its performance:

- **Accuracy**: Measured the overall accuracy of the model in classifying the test dataset images correctly.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Generated a confusion matrix to analyze the classification results, identifying misclassifications among different classes.
- **Classification Report**: Provided a detailed classification report, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

### Key Insights
- **Class Performance**: Identified classes with higher misclassification rates, informing potential strategies for model improvement.
- **Feature Learning**: Gained insights into how the CNN model learns features from images at different layers, enhancing understanding of model interpretability.

## üí° Future Work
Potential next steps to expand this project include:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance by adjusting hyperparameters and architecture settings.
- **Transfer Learning**: Experiment with pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) to leverage existing knowledge for improved accuracy.
- **Model Deployment**: Consider deploying the model as a web application or API for real-time image classification.
